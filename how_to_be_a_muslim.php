                                    If someone advices you to delay your conversion to Islam. This is also incorrect. If you believe Islam is the truth then you should not delay your conversion to Islam. You should convert immediately because we are given a certain lifespan. Since we do not know when we are going to die. Not even a minute should be lost as your time to leave this life may be up the next minute.

                                    Some one may say to you that you must remove all tattoos to be a Muslim. This is also incorrect. Tattoos are not allowed in Islam but they DO NOT prevent a person becoming Muslim. You should become Muslims and latter you can have the tattoos removed if you can afford it. If you can not afford it then do not worry there is no sin on you for what you did before becoming Muslim You are still a Muslim.

                                    <p>No matter what sins you have committed or how wild your past was. You can still become a Muslim.. Islam erases all sins committed prior to becoming a Muslim. Prophet (may the peace and blessings and mercy of Allah be upon him) said, Islam annuls what came before it. (narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, no. 121).As soon as you become a Muslim all your previous sins are forgiven and you start a blank state. Or a complete clean record. </p>
                                    <p>Muslim (121) narrated that Amr ibn al-Aas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When Allah put Islam in my heart, I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: Give me your right hand so that I may swear allegiance to you. He held out his hand and I withdrew my hand. He said, What is the matter, Oh Amr? I said, I want to stipulate a condition. He said, What do you want to stipulate? I said, That I will be forgiven. He said, Do you not know that Islam destroys that which came before it? </p>

                                    <p>Another common question is that there are no Muslims in the city. This too is not an obstacle in you becoming a Muslim. You do not have to go to a Masjid (Mosque) or Islamic center or know any Muslims in order to be a Muslim. You can say the declaration of faith (called the Shahadah) to yourself and from then onwards you are a Muslim. </p>
                                    <p>Some people have a wrong notion that entering into the Islamic fold requires an announcement from the concerned person in the presence of high ranking scholars or shaikhs or reporting this act to courts of justice or other authorities. It is also thought that the act of accepting Islam, should, as a condition, have a certificate issued by the authorities, as evidence to that effect. </p>
                                    <p>We wish to clarify that the whole matter is very easy and that none of these conditions or obligations are required. For Allah, Almighty, is above all comprehension and knows well the secrets of all hearts. Nevertheless, those who are going to adopt Islam as their religion are advised to register themselves as Muslims with the concerned governmental agency, as this procedure may facilitate for them many matters including the possibility of performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) and Umrah. </p>
                                    <p>If anyone has a real desire to be a Muslim and has full conviction and strong belief that Islam is the true religion ordained by Allah for all human-beings, then, one should pronounce the "Shahada", the testimony of faith, without further delay. </p>
                                    <p>Mohammad, the Prophet of Allah (Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him), said: <br /><br />
                                        "The superstructure of Islam is raised on five (pillars): testifying that there is no God (none truly to be worshipped) but Allah, and that Mohammad is the messenger of Allah, performing the prayer, paying the Zakah (poor-due), fasting the month of Ramadan, and performing Hajj".</p>
                                    <p>To become Muslim, you have to pronounce the Testimony of Faith 'Shahada', with sincere faith. </p>
                                    <p>If you accept this, the only thing that remains for you to become Muslim, is to say the Shahada, while believing in it with your heart word for word as follows: <br />The implication of the Shahada is that you believe that there is only one God, Allah, Who alone deserves to be worshipped. It also implies that you believe in Muhammad, peace be upon him, as the Messenger of God, and you believe in his message. It also means that you believe in all of God's Prophets, including Jesus, peace be upon him, who is a Messenger of God and NOT divine or son of God. </p>
                                    <p><em>"ASH-HADU ANLAA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH WA ASH HADU ANNA MUHAMMADAN ABDUHUWA RASUULUH."</em></p>
                                    <p>You may listen to the pronunciation by clicking here </p>

                                    <p>English translation is: <strong>"I bear witness that there is no deity worthy to be worshipped but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger."</strong></p>

                        <p>However, it would not be sufficient for anyone to only utter this testimony oraly either in private or in public; but rather, he should believe in it by heart with a firm conviction and unshakeable faith. If one is truly sincere and complies with the teachings of Islam in all his life, he will find himself a new born person. </p>
                        <p>What should be next after declaring the testimony of faith (Shahada) and then becoming a Muslim? He/She should know the real concept underlying this testimony, which means accepting the Oneness of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), as the last of the Prophets, and meeting its requirements. He/she must behave accordingly applying this true faith to everything he/she says or does. What do the words of "Shahada" signify.</p>
                        <p>The significant point which every Muslim must know is the truth that there is no God to be worshipped other than Allah, (Glory be to Him). He is the only true God, Who Alone deserves to be worshipped, since He is the Giver of life and Sustainer and Nourisher of mankind and all creation with His unlimited bounties. Man must worship Allah, Who Alone is worthy of worship.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the Shahada (i.e., Wa ash-hadu anna Mohammadan rasul-Allah) means that Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) is the servant and chosen messenger of Allah. No one must have two opinions about this matter. In fact the Muslim has to obey the commands of the Prophet (PBUH), to believe him in what he has said, to practice his teachings, to avoid what he has forbidden, and to worship Allah alone according to the message revealed to him, for all the teachings of the Prophet were in fact revelations and inspirations conveyed to him by Allah. </p>
                        <p>Of course faith is not only words but is complemented with action, so upon reciting the Shahada one should begin to learn and uphold his/her duties as a Muslim.  The main pillars of Islam as you know are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Five Daily Prayers </li>
                            <li>Annual charity to the poor and needy</li>
                            <li>Fasting the month of Ramadan</li>
                            <li>Pilgrimage to Mecca (once in a life time for those who are able)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The next step now after the Shahada is to take a complete shower (bath) with the intention of purifying yourself to be ready for prayers.</p>
